* Information
Program that hides or show a text in the least significant bits of the image.

⚠️ For now the output of the document needs to be =.png=

Currently, there are two types of projects:
1) [[https://github.com/JorgeGonzalezPascual/LSB_Steganography/blob/master/LSB_Steganography.py][LSB_Steganography.py]]
2) [[https://github.com/JorgeGonzalezPascual/LSB_Steganography/blob/master/LSB_SteganographyKEY.py][LSB_SteganographyKEY.py]] (Key hiding)

* Installation
This tool requires its dependencies.
: pip install -r requirements.txt
or
: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

* Pending tasks
+ [[https://github.com/JorgeGonzalezPascual/LSB_Steganography/blob/master/LSB_SteganographyKEY.py][LSB_SteganographyKEY.py]] is pending to hide and show the text with a key, for this, my idea is to change the sentinel and that is the key. If you can't find it: Wrong password or there is no message. If found: Correct password and displays the message.
+ Put parameters in the arguments to execute different options of the program.
+ Change the output image extension.
